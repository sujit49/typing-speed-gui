## 📁 File Structure

typing_speed_test/
├── typing_speed_test.py  # Main Python file (the script you run)
└── README.md             # Project documentation

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. No external libraries are required — just run the file:

```bash
python typing_speed_test.py


## 🎮 Instructions
Type anything in the text field.

The timer starts automatically as soon as you start typing.

Press Enter when you finish.

Your typing speed (in WPM) and accuracy will be displayed.

Click the Reset button to restart the test.



## 📐 Accuracy Note
Currently, the app assumes 100% accuracy for demonstration purposes.
To measure real accuracy, you could compare typed text against a fixed reference paragraph.


## 🚀 Ideas for Improvement
Add a reference text to match typing input for real accuracy measurement
Add a countdown before the test begins
Store previous scores for progress tracking
Add a leaderboard or history panel
Include different difficulty levels with longer/shorter text passages
